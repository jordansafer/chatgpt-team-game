# GPT Teamup Game

Game at https://jordansafer.github.io/chatgpt-team-game/

This is a simple project that allows a user to provide an openai key and than work to direct 2 sprites, one through commands to GPT and one through arrow keys. This is a base for more complicated games, and a great extension would be to support GPT sending code when the user requests a repeated, or complex operation.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
